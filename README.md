This is a small game that simulates gravity, drag, and elasticity built using JavaScript.  

Want to see how it looks? [Check out the live demo](https://morellaj.github.io/gravitySim/).

# Phaser 3 Re-implementation
After creating this, I wanted to see what it would be like re-implementing it using a game framework.  I recreated it using Phaser 3, which (no surprise) was much easier.

Here is the [Phaser 3 version repository](https://github.com/morellaj/gravitySimv2). and the [Phaser 3 version live demo](https://morellaj.github.io/gravitySimv2/).
