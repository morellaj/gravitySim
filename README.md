# Phaser 3 Re-implementation
After creating this, I wanted feel what it would be like re-implementing it using a game framework.  I recreated it using Phaser 3, which (no surprise) was much easier.

[Here is the Phaser 3 version repository](https://github.com/morellaj/gravitySimv2).\ and the [Phaser 3 version live demo](https://morellaj.github.io/gravitySimv2/).\.
